                <p> We made World of Emoticons photo installation project to display how teenagers in our generation feel and what goes through their mind. The overall vision of our work is to document different emoticons of daily teenagers life. The experience we want the audience to have is to wonder how each person feels in their photos. We used photos because it captures the  exact moment in the emotions.  For this project we mixed both black and white photos with color photos based on what we thought would look better. We made a question mark to make the audience question the emoticons.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>In Because Education is Knowledge we created a 3d wood sculpture. We created an interpretation of soundwaves based from an audio recording of our voices saying the statement  “Because education is knowledge”. We chose this statement because the words are just so powerful,it shows a message that is simple to understand but at the same time it's not so easy to know what we are trying to say.Our  statement is powerful because it has two important words “education” and “knowledge” that are used all around the world and they are important to most people in order to succeed.Color adds to the overall meaning of the work by going from lightest blue to darkest blue. Once it starts to darken up it means the statement starts to become more powerful. At the end of this project we learned how to make a powerful statement and a few other things in the process.</p>
