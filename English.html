                <h1>The Words</h1>
                <p>I had no clue this would ever happen.... I never felt so much hurt in my life. My mom had gotten a call from my grandma. She was telling us to come over, so we did. When I got there, everyone was sitting outside. I walked in seeing my dad’s friend sitting there with her son. She stood up and grabbed her son’s hand. Then she said, “It’s about Chumpies.” When she said that, I was having a million different things running through my head. I didn't know what to think. My grandma was standing next to me and she grabbed me. Then she said it, the words that broke me into a million pieces: “He passed away this morning.” I fell to the floor in tears. I didn't know what to say or do. All I could do was cry and cry. Ever since that day, I have been trying to get stronger and overcome losing my dad, the one person who meant everything to me. It has made me realize that you should take the moment that you're in and treat it like it's the last, because you never know what will happen. It's been a couple of years since then, and it still hurts. I have gotten stronger since then and realized a lot by this. I was my daddy's little girl and I wish I could still have him here with me. This event made me really shy and self-confined about a lot of things. My dad was one of the only people I trust with anything and everything. This moment defines me because I think that if this would’ve never happened, I wouldn't be so strong or even where I am today. I wouldn't be able to handle half of the things I go through.</p>
